# SchrÃ¶dinger's Vault

Hello, world.   
Or maybe not.

This is a concrete repository.  
You will find nothing. 

Consider this as a record of one mind trying to make sense of the universe.  
Or maybe it's just a grocery list.

The contents are both trivial and profound, until observed.  
You can't observe them.

At least for now.  
Or maybe not.
